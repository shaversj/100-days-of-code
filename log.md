### Day 5: September 22, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Finished completing the Python coding challenge from yesterday. I solved the challenge using two different solutions.

- I initially iterated over a for loop and += 1 to calculate the totals. 
- I then imported Counter from the collections module to return the same results. Counter required me to use a lot less code then what I used at first. Counter returns a dictionary and calculates the totals very easily.

### Day 6: September 23, 2018

**Today's Focus**: I followed an [AWS Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-connect-and-amazon-lex-integration/) and successfully recreated a workflow with Amazon Connect, Lex, Lambda and DynamoDB. 

- I learned how to debug an AWS Lambda fucntion by enabling DEBUG level logging, which allowed me to view the logs with AWS Cloudwatch.
- I also learned how to use Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex.

### Day 7: September 24, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Played around with the Javascript SPA from the [AWS Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-connect-and-amazon-lex-integration/) and enabled Twilio integration with the Amazon Lex bot that I created. The SPA calls DynamoDB directly and uses Amazon Cognito to manage the access to the database.
