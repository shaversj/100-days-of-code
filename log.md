**Today's Focus**: Reading files in Python

Code challenge from [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/06/22-read-from-file.html)

**Details**:

- Explored various ways to read a file in Python, such as:
    - the *readline* approach
        - Reads one line at a time
    - the *for line in file* approach
        - On each iteration, the file cursor is moved to the beginning of the next line.
    - the *read* approach
        - Read the contents of a file into a single string
    - the *readlines* approach
        - Returns a list of strings containing the individual lines from a file
- I used Counter from the Collections module to calculate the number of images in the file.
