### Day 5: September 22, 2018

**Today's Focus**: Finished completing the Python coding challenge from yesterday. I solved the challenge using two different solutions.

- I initially iterated over a for loop and += 1 to calculate the totals. 
- I then imported Counter from the collections module to return the same results. Counter required me to use a lot less code then what I used at first. Counter returns a dictionary and calculates the totals very easily.
